	<p> Travels the globe these days in pursuit of street art festivals. Luckily, many cities have one, and the ONO’U Festival has captured her imagination once again. So lucky us! Our senior reporter on the ground is the quick-witted, eagle-eyed Martha Cooper, who shares with Huffpost readers her fresh shots of the new action here in paradise. She also shares with us some of her personal observations of the artists and the surrounding action, which we elaborate on here for you.</p>

	<p> We start of with Martha’s favorite piece, an octopus made with garbage by the street artist named Bordalo. “He’s a genius! He took the most unlikely pieces of plastic detritus from the recycling center and speedily transformed them into the octopus on the front of what will be Papeete’s street art museum and gallery,” she says. “Cleverly he used the sawed off tops of spray cans as the suckers on the tentacles.”</p>
